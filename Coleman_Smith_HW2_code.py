Problem: University Admission Classification using SVMs

Instructions:
1. Do not use any additional libraries. Your code will be tested in a pre-built environment with only 
   the library specified in question instruction available. Importing additional libraries will result in 
   compilation errors and you will lose marks.

2. Fill in the skeleton code precisely as provided. You may define additional 
   default arguments or helper functions if necessary, but ensure the input/output format matches.
